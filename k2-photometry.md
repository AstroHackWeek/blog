For my AstroHackWeek project, I decided to hack on the new images coming from
[NASA's K2 mission](http://keplerscience.arc.nasa.gov/K2/), the second
generation of the *Kepler* satellite.
The original *Kepler* mission obtained exquisite precision in the photometry
because the satellite's pointing was stable to better than a hundredth of a
pixel.
For *K2*, this is no longer the case.
Therefore, we'll need to work a little harder to extract useful photometric
measurements from these data.
That being said, these pointing variations also break some of the degeneracies
between the flat field of the detector and the PSF so we might be able to
learn some things about *Kepler* that we couldn't have with the previous data
releases.

At the hack week, I got a proof-of-concept implemented but there's definitely
a lot to do if we want to develop a general method.
The basic idea is to build a flexible probabilistic model inspired by what we
know about the physical properties of *Kepler* and then optimize the
parameters of this model to produce a light curve.

The figure at the top of this page shows a single frame observed in the
engineering phase of K2 on the left and, on the right, the optimized model for
the same frame.
The code lives (and is being actively developed) on GitHub
[dfm/kpsf](https://github.com/dfm/kpsf) and the K2 data can be downloaded from
[MAST](http://archive.stsci.edu/search_fields.php?mission=k2) using Python and
the git version of [kplr](https://github.com/dfm/kplr).

<!-- TEASER_END -->

**The Model** —
The model that I implemented at the hack week has the following parameters:

1. the position of the star as a function of time (it currently only fits for
   a single star… a bad limitation!),
2. the brightness of the star as a function of time,
3. a spatially constant background level as a function of time,
4. a PSF model that is fixed in time (currently a free mixture of three
   non-concentric Gaussians; with 15 parameters), and
5. the response or flat field in each pixel (constant in time).

That is a *lot* of parameters and, to make matters worse, I found that it was
useful to integrate the sub-exposure motion of the star when generating the
model for a specific image.
This means that I'm actually constraining the position of the star on much
shorter time scales than the cadence of *Kepler*.
For the time series associated with the image at the top of this page, we need
to fit for about ten thousand parameters.
This is a hard problem so I fired up a software package that I'd been wanting
to use for a while: [Ceres](http://ceres-solver.org/).

**The Technology** —
[Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org/) is an open source C++ library for
solving (big) non-linear least squares problems.
This is good because it is designed to work on problems of the scale that
we're hitting here but it's bad because I don't have much experience using
C++.
As far as I can tell, there are two reasons why Ceres can work on our problem:

1. it uses ["auto
   diff"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) to
   efficiently compute the gradients of the objective function (or residuals
   between the model and observed images) *at compile time*, and
2. it automatically discovers the sparsity in the problem (many of the
   parameters only affect the predictions at a single time or in a single
   pixel) and exploits this structure using [sparse linear
   algebra](http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html).

Both of these features would be very hard to implement robustly from scratch
but they also tie the code base very tightly to the specific choice of
language so I had to struggle through some C++.
After some work and after some conversations with Hogg where we discovered
some "thinkos" in my original formulation, I got a working prototype and [the
codebase has fewer than 300 lines of
code](https://github.com/dfm/kpsf/tree/master/kpsf)!

**The Results** —
At this point, the results aren't particularly impressive; the photometry is
much more precise than the naive aperture photometry used during the original
*Kepler* mission but it isn't (yet) obviously better than [existing
data-driven methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.3853).
That being said, now that I have a better grasp on how to use this powerful
technology, I now have lots of ideas for where to go with this project!

This was only possible because the hack week provided time for me to work on a
"hack" that is important but only peripherally related to my PhD thesis
project.
This, alone, would have made the week worthwhile for me but this was only a
small part of what was so great about this workshop.
The most benefit came from being in the same room with such an eclectic group
of researchers and discussing the many projects that will be hitting these
pages over the next weeks and the others that might have been forgotten after
too much Scotch.
